    "We are all familiar with measurements which are expressed as the amount of one thing for each unit of something else. For example, you may shop for meat sold at a certain number of dollars per pound ($/lb), or you may compute the mileage of your automobile in miles per gallon (miles/gallon). In this experiment, you will be asked to measure the density of a liquid. The density of a substance is usually expressed in grams/mL (grams per milliliter) or g/cm3 (grams per cubic centimeter). This experiment will introduce you to common measuring devices found in the laboratory including the balance, the graduated cylinder, and the buret, and will require you to exhibit knowledge of mathematical concepts including graphing, linear equations, slopes, and intercepts."
