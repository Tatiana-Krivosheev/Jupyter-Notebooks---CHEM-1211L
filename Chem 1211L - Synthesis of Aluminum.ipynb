    "Scientists have been fascinated with crystals for centuries.  Initially, the fascination was with their external beauty; crystalline materials exhibited well-defined symmetry and a variety of interesting colors.  However, within the last 30 years, that fascination has turned inward.  Scientists now study crystals for the structural information they can reveal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term crystal refers to any solid whose atoms form a repeating, three-dimensional pattern.  If a crystal is large enough, you will be able to see some of the pattern reflected in the external appearance of the crystal.  For example, sodium chloride crystals are cubic reflecting the cubic structure of the sodium and chloride ions in the compound.  If a crystal is of the right size and purity, it is possible to determine the structure of the compound making up the crystal, including the location of various atoms, bond angles, and bond lengths.  The technique used to determine the structural identity of compounds is called x-ray crystallography.  Today, it is rare to find a new compound in the literature not accompanied by an x-ray crystal structure.  However, the structural data obtained from this technique are only as good as the crystal from which the data are extracted.  Although books have been written about crystal growth, growing crystals is more of an art than any single technique.  Scientists can spend months trying to get that one perfect crystal for structural determination.\n",

    "In this experiment, you will synthesize crystals of potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate, KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>$\\cdot$12H<sub>2</sub>O, also commonly known as alum.  You will begin by synthesizing alum from an aluminum soda can.  Although the product you obtain from this synthesis will be crystalline, the crystals will be too small for “eyeball” or x-ray analysis.  Therefore, you will grow larger, single crystals from a saturated solution of your alum."

    "The crystals obtained from the synthesis will be too small to provide much structural information, either visibly or through x-ray analysis.  Therefore, the next goal is to synthesize one or more large, single crystals of alum.  We will accomplish this by slowly evaporating a saturated solution of the alum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A saturated solution is one that contains as much of the dissolved solute as possible.  The amount of solid needed to reach saturation is determined by the solid’s solubility at a given temperature.  The solubility of alum in water at several different temperatures is shown in Table 1.  Notice that as the temperature increases, so does the solubility.  This trend is typical for most solids.\n",

    "In practice, it is best to make a saturated solution by adding slightly more solid than required for complete saturation. When the solid no longer dissolves, the solution is saturated. The remaining solid can be removed from solution by filtration. As long as the volume and temperature of the saturated solution remain the same, the solid will remain dissolved in solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large, single crystals can be grown from a saturated solution by slow evaporation of the solvent.  As the solvent evaporates, the concentration of the solute increases.  The solute is now in greater concentration than its solubility permits, and solid will begin to precipitate from solution.  If evaporation is slow enough, the solute will solidify into single crystals with few imperfections or defects.  Your goal is to grow sizable single crystals with a high degree of clarity (i.e., clear not cloudy in appearance)."

Repeat two more times.  After the third rinse, continue to pull a vacuum on the solid until it is completely dry.\n",

Add this amount and a little extra to 20 mL of water in a 50 mL beaker.  Stir the solution for approximately 5-10 minutes to dissolve as much of the solid as possible.  If all the alum dissolves, add a little more to solution.  Saturation occurs when no more solid dissolves.\n",

Filter the solution directly into a small vial.\n",
