    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "When aqueous solutions of inorganic salts are prepared, the ions are stabilized by the process of hydration. Each negative ion (anion) attracts the positive end of water molecules while each positive ion (cation) attracts the negative ends. The positive ions, which are usually smaller than the negative ions show this effect to a greater extent. This results in hydrated cations which may have considerable stability, especially for the di- and tri-valent transition metal ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When aqueous solutions of various salts are concentrated, the forces between water molecules and the hydrated cations are of sufficient strength that the water molecules are retained in the crystal as the solid salt separates from solution. These hydrates can be isolated, and have definite compositions and structures. An example of a hydrate salt is CoCl<sub>2</sub>$\\cdot$6H<sub>2</sub>O (cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate) the cation of which is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hydrate salt](http://localhost:8888/files/Chemistry%20Notebooks/General%20Chem%20Notebooks/Chem%201211L/Chem%201211L%20-%20Figures%20and%20Illustrations/Chem%201211L%20-%20Empirical%20Formula%20-%20Image%201.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this salt, there is one [Co{H2O}6]2<sup>+</sup> ion and two Cl<sup>-</sup> ions present. The cation is bonded to six water molecules in an octahedral array. It should be emphasized that the lines in the figure therefore do not necessarily represent bonds, they merely indicate the shape of the ion. Compounds such as this in which a salt and water are combined in definite proportions are known as hydrates, the water associated with the salt is called water of hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The water bound in these hydrated salts can often be removed at low temperatures (about 120<sup>o</sup>C) in most cases, to produce water and the anhydrous salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CoCl_2 \\cdot H_2O \\rightarrow CoCl_2 + 6H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of water in a hydrate can usually be determined by heating a known amount of hydrate until dehydration occurs. The mass of the hydrate equals the mass of the anhydrous salt plus the mass of the water driven off. The percentage of water in the hydrate can therefore be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$%water = \\dfrac{\\text{mass of water lost}}{\\text{mass of hydrate}} x 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hydrates lose their waters of hydration readily, simply by exposing them to the atmosphere. This process is known as efflorescence. For example, when a sample of MgSO<sub>4</sub>$\\cdot$7H<sub>2</sub>O (known as Epson salt) is placed on a watch glass on the laboratory bench, the following process occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MgSO_4 \\cdot 7H_2O(s) \\rightarrow MgSO_4(s) + 7H_2O(g)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This change produces seven molecules of water vapor per molecule of the hydrate. If the process is carried out in a closed container, the pressure of the water vapor (vapor pressure) can be measured. For this salt, the vapor pressure equals 11.5 torr at 25<sup>o</sup>C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some anhydrous inorganic salts, such as CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub> are hygroscopic that is when exposed to the atmosphere, they absorb water to form hydrates. Such salts are extensively used as drying agents or desiccants. Some compounds of this type actually absorb enough water to dissolve forming a solution. This process is termed deliquescence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, the percentage of water in a hydrate will be determined using the relationship given above. The formula of the hydrate may then be determined by calculating the moles of anhydrous salt and the moles of water of hydration. Their molar ratio is then determined. This relates to the general formula of the hydrate. For example, suppose that the hydrate in question was sodium sulfate decahydrate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>$\\cdot$10H<sub>2</sub>O. The original sample of the hydrate weighed 320.0 mg. After heating the anhydrous salt weighed 141.3 mg. The mass of water lost would therefore be 320.0 - 141.3 = 178.7 mg. The number of moles of water lost would be\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{moles water} = \\frac{\\text{mass of water lost}}{\\text{MW of water}} = \\cfrac{0.1787g}{18.016 \\cfrac{g}{mol}} = 9.918 x 10^{-3} \\text{ moles}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of moles of sodium sulfate would be\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{moles of sodium sulfate} = \\frac{\\text{mass of anhydrous salt}}{\\text{MW of sodium sulfate}} = \\cfrac{0.1413g}{141.96 \\cfrac{g}{mol}} = 9.954 x 10^{-4} \\text{ moles}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ratio of the number of moles,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{moles of water}}{\\text{moles of sodium sulfate}} = \\frac{9.918 x 10^{-3} \\text{ moles}}{9.954 x 10^{-4}\\text{ moles}} = 9.964\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "it is readily seen that there are 10 mole of water associated with each mole of the sodium sulfate."
